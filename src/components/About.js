        <h4>Hello I am Jon Sleight, owner of Jon’s Homebrew and Wine Supply.  I started homebrewing in 1997, after taking a brewing class from the legendary Larry Rifenberick of Larry’s Brewing Supply.  Now, many, many batches of beer later I am bringing everything that I have learned to my own store in my home town of Puyallup.  I spent almost 30 years working in the musical instrument industry helping people learn to play, and acquire quality instruments.  I am excited to bring this passion to a new arena!  We have a great community of homebrewers and winemakers in this area, it will be my honor to do the best I can to support you.  I am looking forward to meeting you and hearing about your homebrewing and winemaking adventures!
